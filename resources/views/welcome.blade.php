                    <tr><td>Luke was so happy with our product that he has recommended us to all his firends and says "without this product helping my studies I would have being totally lost. Time management isn't my strong point and this solved all my assignment needs!".<br />
                        </td><td>I wanted a calendar that looked and worked more like the Web version of Google Calendar, but Google's own app fails in that regard. Then I bought a pair of Samsung devices which replaced Google's app with an even worse implementation. This app, however, came to the rescue. It's better than any other calendar app I've tried. Try the free version first if you're uncertain..<br />
                        </td><td> Have tried various calenders available including the stock and Google Calenders but none cover enough of the bases that I want from a calender app as well as this. However, please can you make it so that the attendees list is sorted into 'Yes', 'No', 'Maybe' and no response? Looking down the list and looking at the end logos isn't easy, particularly as they aren't in a straight column. With this resolved, for me its easily 5 stars!<br />
